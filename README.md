# Encore Agents Framework

This repository provides utility functions and examples for building both [editor agents][editor_agents] and [task agents][task_agents].
Here's how you decide which of the patterns to follow.

![Decision tree for which agent to use](graphics/decision_tree.png)

Some examples of what you could do with each type of agent:

**Editor Agent**:

- _Validate the current state of the annotations_ within a frame, video, or image group.
- Do _custom conversions_ between label types.
- _Trigger notifications_ internally related to the given task.

Think of these agents as agents that your annotators can trigger at will _while they are labeling_.

If you plan to build an editor agent, please go to the [Editor agents section](#editor-agents).

**Task Agents**:

- _Pre-labeling_ of your data, e.g., with your own model or of-the-shelf models.
- _Custom routing_ of data in the project workflow.
- _Dynamic prioritization_ of your tasks.
- _Custom "label assertions"_ that validate, e.g., number of labels or other constraings, before sending them for review.

Think of these agents as agents that will _automatically_ trigger as soon as a task reaches the associated agent state in the project workflow.

If you plan to build a label agent, please go to the [Task agents section](#task-agents).

# Editor agents

For the examples in this section, you have two choices for setups.
You can host your agent via GCP cloud functions or via a self-hosted FastAPI server.
For light-weight application like a label check, we recommend cloud functions, while agents that employ more heavy deep learning models are more suited for a FastAPI setup.
Please expand the example below that suits you the best.

> ðŸ’¡ **Do you prefer another type of hosting?**  
> While we show you two ways in which you can host an editor agent, the options are endless.
> You need to host a public url that accepts POST requests with data of the format (sent from the Encord label editor):

> ```
> {
>     "projectHash": "<project_hash>",  # uuid
>     "dataHash": "<data_hash>",        # uuid
>     "frame": 0                        # int
> }
> ```

> Please see the [full doct][editor_agents] for more details.
>
> There are multiple "nice" utilities in the `encord_agents.core` module which might be useful in other hosting senarios.
> There is, e.g., code for extracting the right frame based on the message from the editor. # TODO make link

## GCP Cloud function examples

### Installation

To use the repo, make sure that you have [Poetry][poetry] installed.
Then, run the following commands.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:encord-team/encord-agents.git
cd encord-agents
poetry install --with gcp-functions
```

Afterwards, every time you want to develope or publish your code, you need to source the poetry environment.
That can be done in a couple of ways:

```shell
poetry run <your command>  # for one command only
poetry shell               # for the shell
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate  # just the python `venv` (Unix only)
```

### Add a bounding box

This example shows how to add a bounding box to the given frame that an annotator is triggering the agent from.

```python
from encord.objects.coordinates import BoundingBoxCoordinates
from encord.objects.ontology_labels_impl import LabelRowV2

from encord_agents.gcp_functions import FrameData, editor_agent


@editor_agent()
def my_editor_agent(frame_data: FrameData, label_row: LabelRowV2) -> None:
    ins = label_row.ontology_structure.objects[0].create_instance()
    ins.set_for_frames(
        frames=frame_data.frame,
        coordinates=BoundingBoxCoordinates(
            top_left_x=0.2, top_left_y=0.2, width=0.6, height=0.6
        ),
    )
    label_row.add_object_instance(ins)
    label_row.save()
```

In the code, we:

1. We mark our function with the `@editor_agent` decorator. That will provide us with two arguments to the function.

   1. A [`FrameData`](TODO) instance which tells which `project_hash`, `data_hash`, and `frame` the agent was triggered from.
   2. A [`LabelRowV2`][label_row_v2] instance already instantiated with the current label state.

2. Create an object instance (assuming that the first object in the ontology is a bounding box object) and call `set_for_frames` with bounding box coordinates and a given frame.
3. Add the new instance to the `label_row`.
4. Save the label row.

> **Quickly replicate the example:**  
> Follow these commands from a shell with the poetry enviroinment activated.

```
encord-gcp-agents build test-project --src-file /path/to/encord_gents/examples/gcp_functions/add_bounding_box.py
cd test-project
encord-gcp-agents run add_bunding_box
```

from another shell, run `encord-gcp-agents test <editor_url>` where `<editor_url>` is the url you see in the browser when you are running editing an image/frame of a video.
