# Encore Agents Framework

This repository provides utility functions and examples for building both [editor agents][editor_agents] and [task agents][task_agents].
Here's how you decide which of the patterns to follow.

![Decision tree for which agent to use](graphics/decision_tree.png)

Some examples of what you could do with each type of agent:

**Editor Agent**:

- _Validate the current state of the annotations_ within a frame, video, or image group.
- Do _custom conversions_ between label types.
- _Trigger notifications_ internally related to the given task.

Think of these agents as agents that your annotators can trigger at will _while they are labeling_.

If you plan to build an editor agent, please go to the [Editor agents section](#editor-agents).

**Task Agents**:

- _Pre-labeling_ of your data, e.g., with your own model or of-the-shelf models.
- _Custom routing_ of data in the project workflow.
- _Dynamic prioritization_ of your tasks.
- _Custom "label assertions"_ that validate, e.g., number of labels or other constraings, before sending them for review.

Think of these agents as agents that will _automatically_ trigger as soon as a task reaches the associated agent state in the project workflow.

If you plan to build a label agent, please go to the [Task agents section](#task-agents).

# Installation

> We recommend that you use python 3.11. Few things will have to be adapted if you want to use a later version.

This repo can be installed as a slim command-line interface (CLI) to help setup and test projects and as a dependency for the implementation of an agent.

### CLI

For the CLI, we recommend installing it via [`pipx`][pipx].

```shell
pipx install https://github.com/encord-team/encord-agents.git
```

Now, you can, e.g., do `encord-agents gcp init <your_project_name>` to initialize a new python project with the
required dependencies for a GCP project.
See [GCP functions](#gcp-cloud-run-functions) below for more details.

### Dependency

There are multiple different extras that you can install - depending on how you want to setup your project.
If you are building a new FastAPI application for editor agents, you should install the project with

```
python -m pip install "encord-agents[fastapi]"
```

if you plan to use the project with GCPs `functions_framework`, then do

```
python -m pip install "encord-agents[gcp-functions]"
```

Finally, if you want to manage all the dependencies on your own, the only necessary dependencies for the `core` module
can be installed with

```
python -m pip install "encord-agents[core]"
```

### Settings

The tool will in many cases have to authenticate with Encord.
For that, environment variables are used.  
Specifically, you need to [setup an ssh key]() for a service account and use the private key to authenticate with.
For any project where you want to use your agent, you will have to assign that service account admin rights.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: for testing, you can may want to use your own personal ssh-key.

To set the environment variables, you should do one of the following two:

1. Set the `ENCORD_SSH_KEY` env variable with the raw key content.
2. Set the `ENCORD_SSH_KEY_FILE` env variable with the absolute path to the key.

If none of them are set, the code will cast a pydantic validation error the first time it needs the ssh key.

> :information_source: Effectively, [this part][docs-ssh-key-access] of the `encord` SDK is used.

# Editor agents

[[ðŸ“š full docs][editor_agents]] [[ðŸ‘† to the top][to_top]]

For the examples in this section, you have two choices for setups.
You can host your agent via GCP cloud functions or via a self-hosted FastAPI server.
For light-weight application like a label checks, we recommend cloud functions, while agents that employ more heavy deep learning models are more suited for a FastAPI setup.

> ðŸ’¡ **Do you prefer another type of hosting?**  
> While we show you two ways in which you can host an editor agent, the options are endless.
> You need to host a public url that accepts POST requests with data of the format (sent from the Encord label editor):
>
> ```
> {
>     "projectHash": "<project_hash>",  # uuid
>     "dataHash": "<data_hash>",        # uuid
>     "frame": 0                        # int
> }
> ```
>
> and responds with a 200 status.
> Please see the [full doct][editor_agents] for more details.
>
> There are multiple "nice" utilities in the `encord_agents.core` module which might be useful in other hosting senarios.
> There is, e.g., code for extracting the right frame based on the message from the editor. # TODO make link

## GCP Cloud run functions

### Add a bounding box

This example shows how to add a bounding box to the given frame that an annotator is triggering the agent from.

First, let's setup a project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/encord-team/encord-agents.git
encord-agents gcp init bounding_box_project --src-file encord-agents/examples/gcp/add_bounding_box.py
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal to create virtual enviroment and install dependencies.

In the `bounding_box_project` directory, you should have a `main.py` file looking like this:

```python
from encord.objects.coordinates import BoundingBoxCoordinates
from encord.objects.ontology_labels_impl import LabelRowV2

from encord_agents import FrameData
from encord_agents.gcp import editor_agent


@editor_agent()
def my_editor_agent(frame_data: FrameData, label_row: LabelRowV2) -> None:
    ins = label_row.ontology_structure.objects[0].create_instance()
    ins.set_for_frames(
        frames=frame_data.frame,
        coordinates=BoundingBoxCoordinates(
            top_left_x=0.2, top_left_y=0.2, width=0.6, height=0.6
        ),
    )
    label_row.add_object_instance(ins)
    label_row.save()
```

In the code, we:

1. We mark our function with the [`@editor_agent`][editor-agent] decorator. That will provide us with two arguments to the function.

   1. A [`FrameData`][frame-data-code] instance which tells which `project_hash`, `data_hash`, and `frame` the agent was triggered from.
   2. A [`LabelRowV2`][label_row_v2] instance already instantiated with the current label state.

2. Create an object instance (assuming that the first object in the ontology is a bounding box object) and call `set_for_frames` with bounding box coordinates and a given frame.
3. Add the new instance to the `label_row`.
4. Save the label row.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: For more information on how to use the SDK to manipulate labels, please see the [SDK documentation][docs-sdk-label] ðŸ“–

From within the directory, you can start the agent by running

```
encord-agents gcp run add_bunding_box
```

From another shell, run `encord-agents test local <target> <editor_url>` to trigger the agent.
`<target>` is the name of the function.
`<editor_url>` is the url you see in the browser when you are editing an image/frame of a video on the platform.

### Other examples

#### Call GPT-4o to varify classifications

#### Label verification

### Deployment

While we refer to the [google documentation][google-gcp-functions-docs] for deployment of cloud run functions, we do provide an example command via the CLI:

```shell
encord-agents gcp deploy <target_function>
```

This will print a template for the command to run against `gcloud` in order to push your function to the cloud.

> :bulb: Remember to configure secrets for the `ENCORD_SSH_KEY`/`ENCORD_SSH_KEY_FILE` variable.
> Documentation is [here ðŸ“–][google-gcp-secrets-docs].

## FastAPI

### Add a bounding box

This example shows how to create a FastAPI project which adds a bounding box the a give frame based on a trigger from the label editor.

First, let's setup a project.

```shell
pyenv local 3.11 # (optional): we use pyenv to manage python versions
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e "git+ssh://git@github.com/encord-team/encord_agents.git#egg=encord-agents[fastapi]" # 'TODO FIX ME'
```

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: If you want to manage dependencies like, e.g., `fastapi` and `uvicorn` on your own, you can install `encord[core]`.
> Please see the [dependencies](#dependency) section for more about details.

Now, let's setup a simple server.
In the directory, create a file called `main.py` with the following content:

```python
from encord.objects.coordinates import BoundingBoxCoordinates
from encord.objects.ontology_labels_impl import LabelRowV2
from encord_agents import FrameData
from encord_agents.fastapi.dependencies import dep_label_row
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from typing_extensions import Annotated

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["https://app.encord.com"],
)


@app.post("/add_bounding_box")
def tmp(
    frame_data: FrameData, label_row: Annotated[LabelRowV2, Depends(dep_label_row)]
):
    ins = label_row.ontology_structure.objects[0].create_instance()
    ins.set_for_frames(
        frames=frame_data.frame,
        coordinates=BoundingBoxCoordinates(
            top_left_x=0.2, top_left_y=0.2, width=0.6, height=0.6
        ),
    )
    label_row.add_object_instance(ins)
    label_row.save()
```

In the code, we:

1. Create a new `FastAPI` app which allows cross-origin communication fro "https://app.encord.com" to be able to recieve messages from the label editor.

1. Define a POST endpoint with two parameters.

   1. A [`FrameData`][frame-data-code] instance which tells which `project_hash`, `data_hash`, and `frame` the agent was triggered from.
   2. A [`LabelRowV2`][label_row_v2] instance already instantiated with the current label state.

1. Create an object instance (assuming that the first object in the ontology is a bounding box object) and call `set_for_frames` with bounding box coordinates and a given frame.
1. Add the new instance to the `label_row`.
1. Save the label row.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: For more information on how to use the SDK to manipulate labels, please see the [SDK documentation][docs-sdk-label] ðŸ“–

From within the directory, you can start the fastapi server by running

```
ENCORD_SSH_KEY_FILE=/path/to/your/private/key fastapi dev main.py
```

From another shell, run `encord-agents test local --port 8000 <editor_url>` to trigger the agent.
`<editor_url>` is the url you see in the browser when you are editing an image/frame of a video on the platform.
Now, try to refresh the browser to see the bounding box appear in the label editor.

### Other examples

#### Call GPT-4o to verify classifications

#### Label verification

### Deployment

While we refer to the [fastapi documentation][fastapi-deploy-docs] for best practices on deployment of fastapi apps, we do provide a basic docker file setup here:

```shell
TODO I suppose that we'd want to do this right?
```

To try the docker image locally, you can run

```shell
docker build -t my_custom_agent:v1
docker run \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    -v /whatever:. \
    -e ENCORD_SSH_KEY=`cat $ENCORD_SSH_KEY_FILE` \
    my_custom_agent:v1
```

Now you should be able to test it with

```shell
encord_agents test local --port 8000 <your_endpoint> <editor_url>
```
