Some examples of what you could do with each type of agent:

**Editor Agent**:

- _Validate the current state of the annotations_ within a frame, video, or image group.
- Do _custom conversions_ between label types.
- _Trigger notifications_ internally related to the given task.

Think of these agents as agents that your annotators can trigger at will _while they are labeling_.
