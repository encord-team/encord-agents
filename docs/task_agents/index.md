## Example use-cases

- _Pre-labeling_ of your data, e.g., with your own model or of-the-shelf models.
- _Custom routing_ of data in the project workflow.
- _Dynamic prioritization_ of your tasks.
- _Custom "label assertions"_ that validate, e.g., number of labels or other constraings, before sending them for review.

Think of these agents as agents that will _automatically_ trigger as soon as a task reaches the associated agent state in the project workflow.
