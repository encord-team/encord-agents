# Encord Agents

Easily build agents for the Encord echo system.
With just few lines of code, you can take automation to the next level.

Here's how to build a [Task Agent](task_agents/index.md) that prioritizes annotation tasks based on custom metadata.

```python title="example_task_agent.py"
from typing import Any

from encord.objects import LabelRowV2
from encord_agents.tasks import TaskRunner

runner = TaskRunner(project_hash="<your_project_hash>")

@runner.stage(name="Agent 1", use_client_metadata=True)
def by_city(lr: LabelRowV2, client_metadata: dict | None) -> str | None:
    location = (client_metadata or {}).get("location")

    priority = 0.
    if location == "New York":
        priority = 1.
    else if location == "San Francisco":
        priority = 0.5

    label_row.set_priority(priority=priority)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    runner.run(update_every=3600, max_workers=1, num_retries=3)
```

This repository provides utility functions and examples for building both [editor agents][editor_agents] and [task agents][task_agents].

**Key features:**

1. ‚ö°**Easy**: Multiple template agents to be adapted and hosted via GCP, own infra, or cloud.
2. ‚è© **Convenient**: the library conveniently loads data via the [Encord SDK][encord_sdk] upon request.
3. üë®‚Äçüíª **Focus**: With essential resources readily available, you can focus on what matters. Create [FastAPI][fastapi] applications for hosting agents with pre-existing dependencies for loading labels and data.
4. ü§è **Slim**: the library is slim at it's `core` and should not conflict with the dependencies of most projects.

**Choose what type of agent to use:**
